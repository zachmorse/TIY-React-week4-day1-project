----- Activity: Unsplash API - Pair Programming -----

In this project, you'll be working with the Unsplash API to create an app where users can search for a category and see a list of images that fit that result.

This project is a photo searching app, in which a user types in a search term to retrieve photos from the database related to the search terms.

It uses react + redux, and uses the react-thunk library to handle asynchronous calls to the Unsplash API.
